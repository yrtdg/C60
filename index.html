        <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.

            He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up which uses, promotes and helps develop the open
            source Solid platform. Solid aims to give people control and agency over their data, questioning many
            assumptions about how the web has to work. Solid technically is is new level of standard at the web layer,
            which adds things never put into the original spec, such as global single sign-on, universal access control,
            and a universal data API so that any app can store data in any storage place. Socially Solid is a movement
            away from much of the issues with the current WWW, and toward a world in which users are in control, and
            empowered by large amounts of data, private, shared, and public.

            Sir Tim is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web standards organization founded in 1994
            which develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web
            to its full potential. He is a Director of the World Wide Web Foundation which was launched in 2009 to
            coordinate efforts to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity.

            A graduate of Oxford University, Sir Tim invented the Web while at CERN, the European Particle Physics
            Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and
            HTML were refined as Web technology spread.

            He is the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering with a joint appointment in
            the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Laboratory for Computer Science and
            Artificial Intelligence ( CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he co-leads the
            Decentralized Information Group (DIG).</p>
